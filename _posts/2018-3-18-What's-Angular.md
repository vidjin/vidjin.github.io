Angular is one of the popular client-side frameworks now, 
so this blog lists down some concise and basic information on it!

## Angular is:

1. Frontend/Client Side JavaScript framework
2. Created and maintained by Google
3. Used to build the powerful single page applications (SPAs)
4. Part of the very powerful MEAN stack (MongoDB-Express.js-Angular-Node.js)
5. HTML for dynamic web applications

## Angular is not:
1. Server-side framework/technology
2. JavaScript library
3. Design pattern like MVC etc.
4. Platform or language
5. Plugin or extension

## History:
1. Angular JS/ Angular 1
2. Angular 2: Completely new based on controllers
3. No Angular 3, skipped
4. Angular 4: Backward compatible with Angular 2, more compact and clean

## Why Angular:
1. Rapid development like validations, routing easily
2. Code generation by CLI to build app faster
3. Code organization & productivity
4. Dynamic content
5. Cross-platform
6. Unit testing ready

So it was my attempt to write about Angular 4 in college notes format to keep it simple! Thanks!
